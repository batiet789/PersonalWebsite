                In high school, I participated in Academic Decathlon, which is an academic competition 
                based around a variety of subjects such as math, english, science, art, and economics.
                The competition consists of multiple choice tests, a written essay section, as well as a
                speech and interview section. Additionally there is the "Super Quiz" event, where a series of
                questions are presented and you can collaborate with your teammates to figure out the correct answer.
                In our team of 9, we spent our time over summer break preparing and studying the material. As a result,
                we performed well in regionals to qualify and participate in the state competition, which was held
                at Sacramento. Although we didn't make it to nationals, I found this experience to be the one I will
                remember the most.
